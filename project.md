    - Block identifiers must be kept.
    - Any spelling or grammatical mistakes should be addressed and corrected.
    - You will develop the tasks list and track the progress.

- **Project data**:
	- Domain name : xampp.local = localhost or 127.0.0.1
    - Server root: "/xampp/htdocs"
    - Project location: "/xampp/htdocs/xampp"

- **Project Details & Goals**:
    - The project will usually be stored at "xampp/htdocs/xampp".
    - Your web projects are typically located at "xampp/htdocs".
    - "xampp/htdocs/index.php" is the XAMPP index page.
    - "xampp/htdocs/xampp/index.php" is the project index page.
    - When accessing localhost, we should fall back to xampp/index.php if it doesnâ€™t exist.
    - The project index.php is the main file of the project.
    - The dashboard will be stored in the project location.
    - XAMPP index.php will load the projectâ€™s index.php.
    - When accessing the projectâ€™s index.php, it will check if xampp/index.php exists:
        - If xampp/index.php does not exist, it will create the file by using a copy stored in the project folder (from /xampp/htdocs/xampp/templates/index.php).
        - After creation, it will redirect the browser to the newly created xampp/index.php.
    - The dashboard will scan all folders in /xampp/htdocs:
        - For each folder, it will:
            - Check if it is a Git repository.
            - Check if the folder contains an index.php or index.html file.
            - If the folder contains a project.json file, it will extract additional configuration like the project name, description, and other details.
    - The dashboard will present a Bootstrap-based, beautiful, and lightweight page displaying:
        - A list of all the userâ€™s projects.
        - For each project, information such as:
            - Project name (from project.json or folder name).
            - Git repository status.
            - A link to the projectâ€™s main page (index.php or index.html).
    - The dashboard will contain a dedicated interface area for future features:
        - Clearly separated from the main project list area.
        - Initially includes a button labeled **"Scan Git Repositories"**.
        - Clicking this button will trigger a script via AJAX to scan and update Git repository statuses dynamically on the dashboard.

- **Tasks and Sub-Tasks [Marked with a 'x' if complete]**:
    - [x] Create project directory structure inside htdocs (/xampp/htdocs/xampp).

        - [x] Check if each folder is a Git repository.
        - [x] Check if the folder contains an index.php or index.html.
        - [x] For each project, check for a project.json file and read its content (like project name, description, etc.).
        - [x] The interface should be a beautiful Bootstrap page displaying:
            - [x] Project name.
            - [x] Git repository status.
            - [x] A link to the projectâ€™s main page (index.php or index.html).
    - [x] Style the dashboard page with Bootstrap to make it lightweight and visually appealing.
    - [x] Interface area for future features:
